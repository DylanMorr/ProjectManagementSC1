                    Speculation of the split came about after Kanyes failed run for president of the USA as his campaign suffered a horrible start after Kanye had a break down on stage over abortion laws showing concern for his mental health. Since the incident Kanye has started doing more church work while
                    still apparently working on a new album. Kim has also been busy with a clothing brand as well as makeup as she has recently been announced to have a net worth of 1 Billion with kanye also having a networth of 1.8 Billion making it interesting to see if they will settle the divorce out of court.
